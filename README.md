### About the Project

Founded in April 2006, Spotify is a Swedish company that offers media streaming and other services. It is the biggest music streaming service in the world, with more than 381 million active users per month, including 172 million paying members.

Here, I've investigated and measured music data and gleaned insightful conclusions.

- Cleaned the data before utilising Python's Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualisation on the Spotify dataset.

- Data analysis: Investigating the link between a song's auditory elements and how favourable or bad its lyrics are, using sentiment analysis and many more techniques.

- Secondary data from Spotify is used in Spotify Data Analysis. Utilise data to find trends and connections between various features. The exercise will help with the development of review and interpretation skills for datasets.
